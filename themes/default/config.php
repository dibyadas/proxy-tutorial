   <p>Your very own proxy service deployed on your Heroku account. Since this service serves only you, it is not only fast, also reliable.
   You may have to allow flash in your browser for certain sites (It is disabled by default).

   	   While this may not work with many sites (like Youtube), it works just fine for many others. This is especially useful for students inside college campus where many sites are blocked by their proxy servers.
